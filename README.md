# Fantasy-Premier-League-Fixtures
This repository includes a short notebook on how to obtain the data for the English Premier League season fixtures

##### When you obtain the data in a CSV file, you can then use simple VLOOKUP function to map the teams to their official names. 
  ##### After doing that, you can use PivotTables to make the fixture schedule. After creating two pivot tables, you can then just copy/paste (second paste --> only on empty cells) it to one table (your schedule of games). For reference or use, I am including my already done Excel workbook for season 2022-2023.
  ###### Note: the data for season 2022-2023 was missing week 7 which is the week when Premier League games were all postponed due to the Queen's passing. So I had to       manually add the event 7 to prevent the schedule from ofsetting by week.
